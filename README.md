# Mobile_Sales_Power_BI_DAX_Formula

## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end example for beginners learning Power BI.  
An interactive and mobile-friendly Sales Analysis Dashboard was created using DAX formulas.  
Through this project, users can gain hands-on experience with data modeling, creating measures, visualizations, and report sharing in Power BI.

## Project Structure

The dashboard consists of three pages:

### 1. Dashboard (Home)
- The main page showing overall sales performance.
- Displays key KPIs such as total sales, total quantity, average price, and transaction count.
- Users can filter by product categories and regions.<br><br>

### 2. MTD Report (Month-To-Date)
- Shows sales performance from the beginning of the current month until today.

### 3. Same Period Last Year Report (SPLY)
- Compares the current period with the same period last year.
- DAX function used: `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR`.
- Allows analysis of annual growth or decline trends.<br><br>

## Time-Based Performance Analysis

Time-based DAX functions were used in the dashboard:

- **MTD (Month-to-Date)**  
  Shows sales from the beginning of the current month until today.  
  *Purpose:* To monitor current month performance and compare with previous months.

- **QTD (Quarter-to-Date)**  
  Calculates data from the beginning of the current quarter until today.  
  *Purpose:* To analyze progress toward quarterly targets.

- **YTD (Year-to-Date)**  
  Shows total sales or revenue from the start of the year until today.  
  *Purpose:* To evaluate achievement of annual goals and growth trends.

- **SPLY (Same Period Last Year)**  
  Compares data with the same period last year.  
  *Purpose:* To measure year-over-year performance differences and trends.
